    <h2>Alex Librando</h2>

     <p>My name is Alex from the City San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, Philippines currently taking up Bachelor 
        of Science in Applied Technology. I enjoy reading and watching educational materials.I am married with 
        four children, a boy and three girls. I used to work for BPO companies for more than ten years but I 
        decided to complete my studies to hopefully change my life a bit.</p>
        <p> The thing that I like about BYU-Idaho 
        aside from it being affordable is its program for online studies that makes it possible for us living 
        outside the United States to complete a degree. I have heard a lot of about the need for web designer and 
        I know of someone who is able to earn more than enough to support his family from this profession and I am 
        hoping to be able to do the same in the future.</p> 
        <p> I came to know of the church at the age of 25 and was baptized then I have been a member now almost half of my life. My favorite quote from our leader is the 
        letter sent to President Gordon B. Hinckley from his father that reads. “forget yourself and go to work” 
        whenever I get discourage from all the trials that comes my way I would remember those words so I can keep 
        on going. </p> 
        <p>I am hopeful that I will be able to complete a bachelors degree in my third attempt to complete 
        one in my lifetime and hope that this will be the last. </p>
